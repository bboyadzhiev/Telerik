01. What database models do you know?
- Hierarchical (tree)
- Network / graph
- Relational (table)
- Object-oriented

02. Which are the main functions performed by a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)?
- RDBMS manage data stored in tables
- implement data manipulation both with the tables and the data stored in them
- support the SQL language
- may sypport transaction management

03. Define what is "table" in database terms.
 - "table" represents data that is arranged in rows(sets of actual data) and columns(data definition of every field in the set)

04. Explain the difference between a primary and a foreign key.
- Primary key is a column of the table filled with values, that are used to uniquely identify a row (record) of the same table.
- Foreign key is a column of the table filled with values, that are used to uniquely identify a row (record) of another table.

05. Explain the different kinds of relationships between tables in relational databases.
- One-to-one relationship - a single record of the current table is related to a single record in the other table.
	Can be used to implement inheritance of the sort Student: Person and Teacher: Person
- One-to-many relationship - a single record in a table corresponds to a single record in the other table.
	Used to implement aggregational type of relation - one country has one or many cities.
	It's the most commonly used relation. 

06. When is a certain database schema normalized? What are the advantages of normalized databases?
- Normalization removes data repetition in tables.
- The deeper the normalization is - the easier the data manipulation is, but it slows down the performance.

07. What are database integrity constraints and when are they used?
- Integrity constraints ensure data integrity in the tables. They enforce data rules which cannot be violated.
	- Primary Key constraint - ensures that the primary key of a table has unique value for each table row.
	- Unique key constraint - ensures that all values in a certain colum(or more colums) are unique. 
	- Foreign key constraint - ensures that the value in given column is a key from another table.
	- Check constraint - ensures that value in certain colum meet some predefined condition.

08. Point out the pros and cons of using indexes in a database.
Pros:
 - Indices speed up searching of values in a certain colum or group of columns.
 - Can be built-in in the tables (clustered) ot stored externally (non-clustered).
 Cons:
 - Adding and deleting records in indexed tables is slower.


09. What's the main purpose of the SQL language?
The main purpose if SQL is the manipulation of data, stored in a relational database.
SQL consists of:
 - DDL (Data Definition Language) - defining the structure of the data - Create, Alter, Drop
 - DML (Data Manipulation Language) - for manipulating the data - Select, Insert, Update, Delete

10. What are transactions used for? Give an example.
Transactions are a sequence of database operations which are executed as a single unit:
- Either all of them execute successfully or none of them is executed.
Example - a bank transfer from one account to another. Withdrawal from the first and deposit into the second account. 
If either the withdrawal of the deposit fails the entire operation should be cancelled.

11. What is a NoSQL database?
NoSQL is a non-relational database that uses document-based model.

12. Explain the classical non-relational data models.
NoSQL databases use document-based model. 
It`s a schema-free document storage that still supports CRUD, indexing, querying, concurrency and transactions.
It`s highly optimized for append/retreive and has a great performance and scalability.


13. Give few examples of NoSQL databases and their pros and cons.
- MongoDB - JSON-document based database.
- CouchDB - JSON-document based database with REST API.
- Cassandra - Distributed wide-column database.
